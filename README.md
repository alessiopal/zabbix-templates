Zabbix templates created for the SMMi monitoring infrastructure.

Some of these templates may be derived from official templates.

You are free to use them ; please tell me if you do so (it is pleasant to feel useful) and redistribute your improvements (a pull request on GitHub would be perfect).

Naming convention
-----------------

* "Pretemplate" is for templates inherited in other templates: they are never directly used in a host
* "Template OS" is for OS templates: only one for each host
* "Template App" is for application templates: one for each application on a host

Documentation
-------------

When a documentation is needed, there is a ".txt" file next to the ".xml" file.
